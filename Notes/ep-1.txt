what is react-
        -React is a JavaScript library created by Facebook
        -tool for building UI components

jsx-:
        -jsx and react are different .
        -jsx is language,which helps to write code in react in simple format.
        -it has html & javascript like syntax.
        -eg:
        const element = <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        - inside of {} we can do js operation.

Babel:
        it is js compiler.
        used to convert JSX into JavaScript. because react recognises js.

ReactDom.render():
        is used to render (display) HTML elements:

React Elements:
        React elements are javascript objects.
        React elements are immutable. They cannot be changed.
        The only way to change a React element is to render a new element every time:
        eg:
            const element = <h1>Hello React!</h1>

React Components:
        React components are JavaScript functions.
        it can re-render, so we put React Elements inside of it.
        it gives javascript object ( object renders structure of UI)
        eg:
            const HeadingComponent=()=>(
                <div>
                    <h1 className="heading">Namaste react</h1>
                    {100+5}
                </div>
            )

Actual Dom- "div,img,p,span" etc. tags are actual Dom

virtual Dom/object- virtual representation of acutal DOm or structure of actual Dom.

why react is so fast?
    -it can do fast DOM manipulation or operation.
    -it keeps UI link with data-link layer.
    -react creates "virtual Dom" of "actual Dom" and performes DOM manipulation on it .

React uses "Diff algorithm"
                    -when there is changed in react object
                    - it recognises differnce betn old virtual DOm and New virtual Dom and render on UI.
